# Marlin Configuration
The XYZ stages are controlled by a 
[Bigtreetech SKR Pro v1.2](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-skr-pro-v1-1-32-bit-control-board?variant=29207358865506)
3D-printer mainboard running [Marlin](). It is equipped with 
[TMC2209 stepper drivers](https://biqu.equipment/collections/driver-board/products/bigtreetech-tmc2209-stepper-motor-driver-for-3d-printer-board-vs-tmc2208)
for quiet and smooth movements.

You can use the provided configuration files to build a custom firmware version based on **Marlin 2.0.9.2**. We 
configured Marlin to work best with the stepper drivers and *EMFI Station*. More information on how to build and 
configure the firmware can be found in the [Marlin installation guide](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install.html).
